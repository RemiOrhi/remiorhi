        <p>
        I'm the cherry laced ghoul 
        <br>With the alpine berry juul
        <br>You read my lips in the fog
        <br>I say nothin'
        <br>Nothing of importance to no one anywhere
        <br>Empty oxygen thieves
        <br>Running in mid air
        <br>Crying outside, double click, despair
        <br>It's cold outside when you got no pride to wear
        <br>No pride to wear
        <br>Oh
        <br>Speak through me
        <br>You got my thoughts on lock
        <br>You know I'm always there for you
        <br>Through me
        <br>You got my thoughts on lock
        <br>You know I'm always there for
        <br>You
        <br>You
        <br>There for
        <br>Wait for me, wait for me, I cannot breathe
        <br>I can't just run away so I just sink
        <br>Rollin'
        <br>Floating
        <br>I need more
        <br>I see corpses float above
        <br>Speak through me
        <br>You got my thoughts on lock
        <br>You know I'm always there for
        <br>You
        <br>You
        <br>Always
        <br>So
        <br>I'll die
        <br>In the woods
        <br>Tonight
        <br>If only
        <br>I have
        <br>Your hand
        <br>In mine
        <br>So
        <br>Oh, I'll die
        <br>In the woods
        <br>Tonight
        <br>If only
        <br>I have
        <br>Your palm
        <br>Of your hand in mine
        </p>
